        <h4> Hi everyone!</h4><br>
        <h4> I'm a simple girl who loves music, photography, martial arts and aesthetically pleasing things. <br> 
            My love for photography brought me to a world of graphic design, which then lead to coding. When I have some free time I like to relax while watching a movie, TV show, read something interesting, or just surf the internet looking for interesting facts about this amazing world that we live in. </h4>
        <h3> Fun facts about me </h3>
        <h4><ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li>-> I'm always wearing headphones.</li>
            <li>-> I'm driving my colleagues insane with constant tapping with fingers on the tables in the rhythm of the song that's playing in my head</li>
            <li>-> Sometimes I see things that no one else can see, and sometimes I can't see things that everyone else sees.</li>
            <li>-> I have a cat and a bunny.</li>
            <li>-> I've been training martial arts since February 2003.</li>
        </ul></h4>
